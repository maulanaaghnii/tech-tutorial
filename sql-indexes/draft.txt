1. CREATE INDEX Statement
An index in SQL can be created using the CREATE INDEX statement. This statement allows you to name the index, to specify the table and which column or columns to index, and to indicate whether the index is in an ascending or descending order.

```
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name;
```

2. Unique Indexes

Unique indexes are used not only for performance, but also for data integrity. A unique index does not allow any duplicate values to be inserted into the table. It is automatically created by PRIMARY and UNIQUE constraints when they are applied on a database table, in order to prevent the user from inserting duplicate values into the indexed table column(s). The basic syntax is as follows.

```
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name
on table_name (column_name);
```

3. Single-Column Indexes

A single-column index is created only on one table column. The syntax is as follows.

```
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column_name);
```

4. Composite Indexes

A composite index is an index that can be created on two or more columns of a table. Its basic syntax is as follows.

```
CREATE INDEX index_name
on table_name (column1, column2);
```

5. Implicit Indexes

Implicit indexes are indexes that are automatically created by the database server when an object is created. For example, indexes are automatically created when primary key and unique constraints are created on a table in MySQL database.


6. Drop Index Statement

An index can be dropped using SQL DROP command. Dropping an index can effect the query performance in a database. Thus, an index needs to be dropped only when it is absolutely necessary.

```
DROP INDEX index_name;
```
